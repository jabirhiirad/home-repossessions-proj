# Home Repossessions Analysis

Here is the repo for a project I conducted where I took a dataset from Kaggle and analysed the data to draw relevant conclusions. 

Predominantly using the Pandas library, and using relevant information, I was able to draw graphs to better understand the data in the dataset, and offer reasons why the data is how it is.

The write-up explains this in more detail. It is available in this repo.
